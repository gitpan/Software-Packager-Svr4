DESCRIPTION

Software::Packager::SVR4 is based on Software::Packager::Solaris,
but does not depend on any native pkg* commands.  It is meant to
create SVR4 packages for any SVR4 platform (e.g. SCO, Solaris),
but has only been tested on Solaris.  Currently it can only
create dir-format packages.  The stream-based (*.pkg) format SVR4
packages should be supported shortly.

For more details see the documentation on Software::Packager
